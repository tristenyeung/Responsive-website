# Responsive-website

For this assignment I referenced the video linked below for inspiration. I adapted the elements to suit our assignment by splitting the portfolio website into the required pages. I learned a lot from the video! For example, I didn't know that variables could be used in CSS. I also recognized quite a few pieces of Javascript functions and structure from class in the features I included in the site.

One of the javascript features I included can be found on in about.html. The page will display different qualifications based on when you click "education" or "work"

The other javascript feature I included can be found in portfolio.html. I wanted to include a swiping carousel of my portfolio content. It works by clicking on the coloured dots underneath the carousel. I tried for a long time to figure out why the arrows won't activate the code but I ran out of time.

I will also be copying this into the Blackboard submission since my vercell links have not been working in the past.
